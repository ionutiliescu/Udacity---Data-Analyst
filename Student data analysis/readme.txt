Analysis of student data from Udacity courses.

The data is pulled from 3 datasets:

- daily_engagement - engagement of students per day, showing things like the total minutes spent or lessons completed
- enrollments - details about individual student enrollment
- project_submissions - information about the rating obtained by students on certain projects

As objective, the data has to be organised properly in the right formats, irelevant fields elliminated and new ones added.

Also, insights have to be drawn from data to respond various questions presented in the markdowns and comments inside the notebook.

The main dataset which the notebook is working with is a combination of the above, with data of the students from their first week of enrollment.
